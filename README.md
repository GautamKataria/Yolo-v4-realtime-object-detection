# Yolo-v4-realtime-object-detection

Dont forget to download the preequisites to using the yolov4 model on your local machine in my YOLOV4 Tutorials 
repository link --> [Prerequisites to yolov4](https://github.com/GautamKataria/YOLOv4-Tutorials)

This repository houses the code required to run a state of the art yolo-v4 model to detect objects in realtime 

COPY the contents into the x64 folder in your darknet build

MOVE the mp4 files into the data folder inside the x64 folder of your darknet build

Also dont forget to download the weights for yolov4 model trained on coco dataset with 80 classes move it to the same x64 folder

[Link to weights file download here](https://github.com/AlexeyAB/darknet/releases/download/darknet_yolo_v3_optimal/yolov4.weights)

Run the object_detection_gui.py app

Be sure to check out the help button while running the gui to get to know the working of this application
